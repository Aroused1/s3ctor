#s3ctor#
##An Oxide Mod to handle temporary warps##
Need to let people warp to your arena, but only when you're ready? Perhaps you'd like to let them pop into town without giving up a valuable home teleport slot. S3ctor is designed for utility styled warps across the server.

##Commands##

###/setjump [location]###
Add a new jump. Admin only. Jumps are disabled by default.

###/jump [location]###
Jump to a location. Default delay is 40 seconds.

###/togglejump [location]###
Admin only. Toggle whether a jump is usable or not. Jumps-in-progress will still complete.

##Installation##
Drop into your mods/ folder in your oxide install. For further instructions, see your server host.
